You can have _*strong and empashized*_ text.

You can also apply styles to _*`verbatim`*_.

But verbatim will `_*preserve*_` them.

You can use _single *markers.

But you \_need\_ to escape pairs.

Even though you can escape \_only one_ of the two.

If you have \_more than two\_ it's better to just \_escape\_ all of them.

Oh, this is valid for `verbatim as well.
