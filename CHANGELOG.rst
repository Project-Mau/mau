Changelog
=========

Version 3.1.0
=============

- [fix] Added RawNode node and make source blocks emit lists of RawNode instead of TextNode. This prevents escaping characters in formats like HTML. Raw blocks now use a list of RawNode as well.

Version 3.0.3
=============

- [enhancement] Better error reporting
- [fix] Fixed incorrect context passed to sub parsers

Version 3.0.2
=============

- [fix] Fixed missing transfer of args and kwargs through visitor functions
- [fix] Added the missing macro node visitor function
- [fix] Tidy up configuration of development tools
- [enhancement] Management of visitor configuration (variables) moved to the class BaseVisitor

Version 3.0.1
=============

- [fix] Fixed type hints to keep compatibility with Python 3.8

Version 3.0.0
=============

This is a major rewrite of the Mau engine that introduces some incompatibilities with the syntax of Mau 2.x. Please check the documentation for more details.
The source code now contains a basic visitor that returns the AST and a Jinja visitor which works with any Jinja template. Other visitors are being migrated to plugins that have to be installed separately. The HTML and Markua visitor have been ported from version 2.x, and a PDF Visitor has been added. The AsciiDoctor visitor has been removed.

Version 2.0.3
=============

- [enhancement] Added two new styles: `^caret^` and `~tilde~`. Since in both Markua and AsciiDoctor these are connected with superscript and subscript this has been implemented as the default behaviour of the HTML visitor.

Version 2.0.2
=============

- [fix] Markua footnotes contain an hash that avoids clashes.
- [fix] Markus footnotes end with a newline so they are not rendered on the same line.
- [fix] Resolved issue #4: README updated to reflect the current API.
- [fix] HTML visitor escapes special characters like `&`, `>`, and `<` in verbatim and links.
