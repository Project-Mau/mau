= Test inline nodes

This document contains the standard inline nodes that can appear in a paragraph.

This is a normal paragraph that is followed by an empty line.

This is a paragraph split in two lines.
The missing empty line makes the two line belong to the same paragraph.

This paragraph contains `verbatim` text and the supported styles: _underscore_, *star*, ~tilde~ and ^caret^.

Here we use [class]("classes", "class1,class2").

A paragraph with an inline image [image]("https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/images/global/favicon.jpg").

Links like there was no [link]("https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com", "tomorrow"). Also without text: [link]("https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com").

You can use the macro `mailto` to format email links. If you need to know more write me at [mailto]("info@example.com").
