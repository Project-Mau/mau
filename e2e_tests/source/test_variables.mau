:answer:42
:wikipedia_link:[link]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)")

This file tests variables. Above there is a definition of the variable `answer`, which is used in the next sentence.

The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is {answer}.

There is also a definition of a full link macro: {wikipedia_link}.

Interpolation can be blocked escaping the curly braces: \{answer}. This happens automatically in verbatim: `{answer}`.

:true:
:!false:

Mau supports booleans: {true} and {false}.

:value:5
:module.value:6

You can also use namespaces with a dotted syntax: {value} and {module.value}.
