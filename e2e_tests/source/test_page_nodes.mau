This file tests some of the page nodes like header.

// This is a comment and will not appear in the output.

I'm skipping some steps here.

comment.
All these lines will disappear.

Just above this paragraph there should be a horizontal line.

A bit more fun with styles, just to check that everything is working.

You can have _*strong and empashized*_ text.

You can also apply styles to _*`verbatim`*_.

But verbatim will `_*preserve*_` them.

You can use _single *markers.

But you \_need\_ to escape pairs.

Even though you can escape \_only one_ of the two.

If you have \_more than two\_ it's better to just \_escape\_ all of them.

Oh, this is valid for `verbatim as well.

This is an unordered list

* Item 1
* Item 2
** Item 2.1
** Item 2.2
* Item 3

This is an ordered list

# Item 1
# Item 2
## Item 2.1
## Item 2.2
# Item 3

Finally, let's include an image.
