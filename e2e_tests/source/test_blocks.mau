[admonition, class="warning", icon="someicon", label="somelabel"]
----
This is an admonition, which is a specific type of block with a `class`, and `icon`, and a `label` that work as a title. This block is implemented purely through Jinja templates.

The following is a quote from a book. Quotes are not special in Mau, they are standard blocks rendered through the template `block-quote`. You can use secondary content to include the source.

[quote]
----
Some of the newer ones are having trouble because they never really mastered some basic techniques, but they’re working hard and improving.

Orson Scott Card, _Ender's Game_ (1985)

Of course you can use attributes to specify the attribution, but this way you cannot use Mau code. Remember to change the template if you want to go down that route.
